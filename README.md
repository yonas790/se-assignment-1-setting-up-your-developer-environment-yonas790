   here is steps to install VS Code: 
      1. Download the Installer from the link provided above or from thier official website
      2. Run the Installer
      3. Follow the Setup Wizard
      4. Install

3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com
   To install Git:
      1. Download the installer form the official website https://www.git-scm.com/
      2. Follow the Setup Wizard
      3. Complete the Installation
      4. Verify the Installation using the command --vertion on cmd
   How to configure in local machine
      1. Set name using the command git config --global user.name "Name" 
      2. Set Email using the command git config --global user.email "Email"
      3. Verify configration using the command git config --list
   How to create GitHub account for hosting repositories
      1. Go to the website https://github.com
      2. Sign Up for an account 
      3. Enter detail
      4. Verify account
      5. create repository 
      6. Enter detail about repository name ...
   Initialize a Git repository for project and make first commit
      1. To initialize use the git init command on desired directory
      2. clone or add files we want to push
      3. use git commit -m "Initialize commit" command to make commit
      4. use git add . command to push that all we made
      5. using git push command we can upload to the GitHub repository

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.
   How to install python
      1. Run python Installer
      2. Customize Installation Options
      3. Start Installation
      4. Verify Installation
      5. Install pip and additional tools

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).
   If Python is installed correctly, pip should come bundled with it. However, depending on the system and Python installation method, it may need to verify or install pip separately. Hereâ€™s how to ensure pip is installed and ready to use:
      1. To check weather if it is insataled, use this command pip --version
      2. If not download get-pip.py script from official website

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html
   Steps to download and install MySQL database on windows:
      1. Go to official website https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html
      2. Download the installer
      3. Run
      4. Follow the setup wizard and customize Installation opition
      5. Install
7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.
   Both Docker and virtual machines are excellent tools for achieving isolated project dependencies and consistent environments. 
   Choosing the right tool depends on specific needs:
      1. For modern applications with well-defined dependencies, Docker is a great choice due to its speed, efficiency, and portability.
      2. f you need to run legacy applications, require stricter isolation, or want more flexibility in terms of supported operating systems, then VMs are the way to go.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.
   My chosen text editor or IDE is VS Code.
   Available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for VS Code editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration:
      1. Syntax Highlighting: Better TOML
      2. Linting: Pylint
      3. code formatting: Prettier
      4. Version Control Integration: GitLens

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 
    This document outlines the steps taken to set up my development environment, including chosen tools, configurations, customizations, and any troubleshooting encountered.
